      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
      <hr><br><br>
      <h2 id="why-a-code-of-conduct-">Why a Code of Conduct?</h2>
      <p>Codes of Conduct aren&#39;t new. In fact, they&#39;re really, really old. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi">Code of Hammurabi</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Pillars_of_Islam">Five Pillars of Islam</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath">Hippocratic Oath</a> are ancient examples of codes of conduct. <strong>The code outlines the principles, standards and behavioral expectations of a society or community. </strong></p>
      <p>As communities in tech have formalized, so has the need for codes of conduct. As a group of people expands, the diversity of that group tends to grow as well. <em>This is great!</em> We get new perspectives and ideas. It&#39;s like breathing life into a space. </p>
      <p>For all it&#39;s benefits — and there are <em>endless</em> benefits — social diversity can be hard. If you&#39;ve never heard of social diversity, it&#39;s the kind of diversity expressed by gender, race, ethnicity, religious beliefs, language, geographical origin and sexual orientation. And humans are, well, complicated. Social diversity can sometimes cause conflict. And discomfort. </p>
      <p>Think about when you&#39;ve been excluded from a group. Do you remember how that felt? You probably felt different, rejected, alone. Those are dark feelings. <strong>And we don&#39;t want anyone involved in our community to feel that way. </strong></p>
      <p>We are all different. Some of you are the oldest person in your community. Some of you are the youngest. Maybe you&#39;re the only man. Or woman. Or person of color. Perhaps you struggle with anxiety, depression. Maybe you have diabetes. A disability. You&#39;re married. Have kids. You&#39;re single. You care for an ailing parent. </p>
      <p>Privilege is a difficult thing to talk about because it&#39;s invisible. And it&#39;s impossible for any of us to truly know the intentions and history and stories of another human. </p>
      <p>But here&#39;s what we do know. There are marginalized groups involved in tech. (Yay! We love them and want to keep them!) These people, historically, have received horrendous treatment. And they continue to suffer from systemic abuse. <strong>It is those people for whom a code of conduct attempts to protect. </strong></p>
      <p>If you&#39;re thinking, &quot;This doesn&#39;t need to be said!&quot; You&#39;re (probably) not the problem. It can be hard to fully understand how much someone else puts up with on a daily basis. From being made to feel unsafe, to enduring microaggressions, all the way to full-on discrimination. Your perspective (and mine) doesn&#39;t matter nearly as much as theirs. If someone is made to feel unsafe, it is our responsibility to fix it. Codes of conduct provide a platform for everyone to express themselves without fear of oppression. </p>
      <p>Codes of conduct are not punitive. They are not political. They are not intended to restrict you from having fun nor are they guaranteed to protect you from all uncomfortable social situations. </p>
      <p><strong>Simply put, a code of conduct is a baseline of behavior. And a framework for how to respond to and solve conflict between people. </strong></p>
      <h2 id="pycolorado-s-code-of-conduct">PyColorado&#39;s Code of Conduct</h2>
      <p>PyColorado is a community conference. It serves as a place to learn, grow, network and collaborate in the developer community. </p>
      <p><strong>We value the participation of each member of the Python community</strong> and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. All attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially sponsored by the Python Software Foundation or not.</p>
      <p>To make clear what is expected, all staff, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at any PyColorado event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>
      <h2 id="our-standards">Our Standards</h2>
      <p>PyColorado is dedicated to providing a positive conference experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education or socio-economic status.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li>Being kind to others.</li>
      <li>Behaving professionally.</li>
      <li>Assuming positive intent in others.</li>
      <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language.</li>
      <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.</li>
      <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.</li>
      <li>Focusing on what is best for the community.</li>
      <li>Showing empathy towards other community members.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li>Harassment of conference participants in any form.</li>
      <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following. </li>
      <li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
      <li>Sexual language and imagery in any conference venue, including talks. </li>
      <li>Insults or put downs.</li>
      <li>Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic or ableist jokes.</li>
      <li>Unwelcome sexual attention or advances.</li>
      <li>Unwelcome physical contact.</li>
      <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events.</li>
      <li>Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.</strong></p>
      <p>If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate. This will typically begin with a warning. If the behavior continues, the participant will be removed from the conference with no refund. </p>
      <p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>
      <h2 id="weapons-policy">Weapons Policy</h2>
      <p>No weapons are allowed at conference venues, including but not limited to explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Attendees are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.</p>
      <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
      <p>All PyColorado attendees and participants are subject to this code of conduct. This includes PyColorado organizers and volunteers, as well as attendees of the tutorials, workshops, summits, poster sessions, receptions and sponsored or unofficial events.</p>
      <p>Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths or similar activities are also subject to the code of conduct. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment. </p>
